# HomeworkBounty
Homework Bounty Project
An attempt to learn Ruby on Rails by implementing a StackOverFlow like community for students helping other students with homework.

To make the project applicable in the course "DD2471 Modern Database Systems and Their Applications" the backend uses MongoDB instead of SQL.
